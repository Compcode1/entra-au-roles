    "\n",
    "‚úÖ These three roles are among the most commonly used built-in roles in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), especially in delegated administration scenarios using:\n",
    "Administrative Units (AUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiered IT support models\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoped access for helpdesk, HR, or IT teams\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîé Why These Roles Matter in Practice and on the SC-300:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Password Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most basic delegated support role.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows front-line IT or HR to assist with user password resets without risking exposure to broader directory configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the first role scoped to AUs in decentralized environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Offers broad control over users and groups, suitable for departmental IT leads or power users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegated per AU or globally, depending on how much trust is granted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also comes up frequently in B2B (guest access) and lifecycle management.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Authentication Policy Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical in environments where MFA, passwordless sign-in, or Conditional Access enforcement is evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often used centrally by identity security teams, but can be scoped via AUs in larger orgs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its use is increasing with Microsoft‚Äôs shift toward identity-driven Zero Trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "**üß† Summary Insight:**\n",
    "These roles represent tiered levels of access that map directly to real-world operational patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support ‚ûù Password Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ops ‚ûù User Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security/Identity ‚ûù Authentication Policy Administrator**\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Test Scope Boundaries**\n",
    "Explore how role scoping affects management:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario\tExpected Outcome**\n",
    "manager.hr resets hr.user1 password\t‚úÖ Success\n",
    "manager.hr resets sales.user1 password\t‚ùå Not permitted\n",
    "manager.sales manages shared.user\t‚úÖ Can manage shared.user, but only HR-scoped properties\n",
    "manager.it manages shared.user\t‚ùå Not permitted\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 1: Manager.HR resets HR.User1 password**\n",
    "Expected Outcome: Permitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Why and How:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.HR is assigned the Password Administrator role scoped to the HR AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "HR.User1 is a member of the HR AU, so the role applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Manager.HR opens the Microsoft Entra portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "They navigate to Users > HR.User1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Reset Password\" button is available and functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "No access errors occur because scoping aligns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 2: Manager.HR attempts to reset Sales.User1 password**\n",
    "Expected Outcome: Not Permitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Why and How:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales.User1 is in the Sales AU, not in the HR AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.HR‚Äôs role does not extend beyond the HR AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "If Manager.HR searches for Sales.User1, they will not see the user in the directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if accessed indirectly (e.g., via group membership), action buttons like ‚ÄúReset Password‚Äù are missing or greyed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attempting REST API calls with Graph Explorer would return a 403 Forbidden error unless scope includes Sales AU.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3: Manager.Sales manages Share.User**\n",
    "(Share.User is assigned to both Sales and HR AUs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcome: Permitted, but only within the Sales AU context\n",
    "\n",
    "Why and How:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.Sales holds User Administrator scoped to the Sales AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Share.User is multi-scoped (in both Sales and HR AUs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Entra scoping rules apply \"scope filtering\", meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.Sales can:\n",
    "\n",
    "View Share.User in the portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify attributes that are not AU-exclusive (e.g., general profile settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Reset passwords only if User Administrator grants that right (which it does).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cannot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign Share.User to groups outside the Sales AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edit AU-specific policies if restricted to HR.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Clarification on confusing prior statement:\n",
    "Previous note saying ‚Äúcan manage only HR scoped properties‚Äù was incorrect/confusing.\n",
    "The correct logic is: Manager.Sales can manage Sales AU‚Äìscoped access only.\n",
    "They do not see or control any access tied to the HR AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 4: Manager.IT manages Share.User**\n",
    "Expected Outcome: Not Permitted\n",
    "\n",
    "Why and How:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manager.IT is scoped to the IT AU, and Share.User is not in IT AU.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role is Authentication Policy Administrator, which:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only manages conditional access policies, authentication methods, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires user visibility to function ‚Äî and AU scoping prevents that visibility here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the portal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Share.User does not appear in directory search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role-related settings (like enforcing MFA) are not applicable to users outside the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to browse policy interfaces yields no editable user list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary Learning Points:**\n",
    "Role scope visibility is enforced in the Entra portal UI and API calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-AU users are visible to all scoped admins, but editable attributes depend on admin role + AU scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Built-in roles behave differently based on whether they target user management (e.g., reset password) or policy management (e.g., conditional access).\n",
    "\n",
    "Test environment simulation is critical to building intuition about real-world delegation and isolation in large organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîç Reflections and Concepts**\n",
    "**üß† Key Learnings**\n",
    "Microsoft Entra built-in roles behave differently depending on their function‚Äîpassword resets, user lifecycle management, or policy control‚Äîand AU scope strictly governs their reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "A user assigned to multiple AUs is visible and partially manageable by admins scoped to any of those units, but only within the role‚Äôs allowed actions and the AU‚Äôs boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Password Administrator is a minimal risk role for frontline support; User Administrator enables deeper account and group changes; Authentication Policy Administrator governs how users authenticate‚Äîbut requires scoped visibility to take effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project mirrors real-world delegation needs in large organizations, where departments require autonomy without compromising security or overprovisioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the interaction between role type and AU scope is foundational to mastering Microsoft Entra identity management and performing well on SC-300.\n",
    "\n",
    "**‚ö†Ô∏è AU Limitations**\n",
    "No nesting: AUs do not support hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "No inheritance: A tenant-wide role overrides AU limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Role scoping is strict: Only affects users inside the AU ‚Äî groups and devices are not in scope unless explicitly added.\n",
